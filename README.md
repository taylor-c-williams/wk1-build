# Red-Green-Refactor Build

In this build you will use the Red, Green, Refactor approach to create a function
that takes a base and exponent and raises the base to the exponent power:
base<sup>exponent</sup>.

## Red

Write failing test and commit (use a meaningful commit message).

## Green

Get the test to pass and commit (use a meaningful commit message).

## Refactor

Refactor your code if you can and commit (use a meaningful commit message).

## First Pass: Use Math.pow

Use [Math.pow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/pow)
in your implementation

## Second Pass: Use the exponentiation operator

Use the [exponentiation operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Exponentiation)
in your implementation.
